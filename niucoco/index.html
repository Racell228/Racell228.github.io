		<h1>ONE BASIC INGREDIENT IS THE TRICK TO HAVING GREAT HAIR</h1>

			<h2>COULD YOU BE KILLING YOUR HAIR WITH CHEMICALS?</h2>
			<p>Raise your hand if this is you: dry, brittle hair, an itchy scalp, color damage, or simply speaking, hair that doesn’t ever look as nice as you want it to, even after an expensive blowout. </p>
			<p>The culprit? Your shampoo. Your conditioner. Your routine.</p>
			<p>Did you know that most shampoos on the market are filled with harmful chemicals that are without a doubt messing up the quality of your hair? Sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, synthetic fragrances, ammonia, and bleach are a few harsh ingredients that regularly make it into your standard shampoo bottle, and even some of the specialty ones you’re buying! And you don’t even want to  These compounds can strip your hair of its natural oils, irritate the scalp, and increase the likelihood of developing split ends and breakage—not to mention completely ruin that pricey dye job.  </p>
			<h2>WELCOME TO MY PROBLEMS.</h2>
			<p>Having a head of thick, curly (and sometimes frizzy, sometimes split ended…) hair often means a lot of experimentation and a LOT of maintenance. Vitamins and nutrients are absolutely essential to the growth and health of all types of hair.  But how does one keep up? How could one possibly know which is the most beneficial for their hair, lest without trial and error? </p>

			<h2>A SNEAKY SOLUTION</h2>
			<p>The thing is, this one magic component has been under my nose the whole time, and yet, I never thought it would be so valuable to my locks! But after using a product so rich with the vitamin for only a couple of weeks, my tresses went from Sideshow Bob to bouncy and bountifully curled as Shirley Temple’s. </p>
			<p>And all this wouldn’t be possible without the magic touch of Vitamin E. </p>
			<p>Vitamin E is the collective name for a group of compounds with antioxidant properties. Some foods are rich in Vitamin E, such as almonds, spinach, sweet potato, avocado, and coconut. </p>
			<p>Vitamin E slows the aging process of your cells, and protects against cell damage - which is why it’s often used in skincare products. But it also works similarly for your hair in the following ways:</p>
			<p>- Its high antioxidant properties repair damaged hair follicles, prevent tissue corrosion, and help build tissue.<br>- Like it does for your skin, it also protects your hair from the harsh sun.<br>- It promotes blood circulation and acts as deep moisturizer for your hair, preventing breakage and brittleness.</p>
			<p>And how does one get all this goodness infused into their hair?</p>
			<p>Eating avocado everyday could help, of course (so chow down, sweetheart - chow down!) but also incorporating the ultimate moisturizer, coconut oil, into your everyday hair routine.</p>
			<p>Why coconut oil? Won’t my hair look greasy? Well, an awesome, natural sourced coconut oil made from quality and infused into quality products can make a world of a difference. I found an amazing line of products containing more pure coconut oil than other brands on the market. </p>

				<h2>MEET NIUCOCO</h2>
				<p>NIUCOCO is a gorgeous haircare brand that uses 100% virgin coconut oil in their mighty collection of haircare products. This comes from their head scientist Yasmine Ishmael, who grew up with the West Indies tradition of nourishing her hair with pure coconut oil. Coming to full circle, Yasmine started implementing it into her personal routine as an adult, and lo and behold - results started coming in after a short amount of time. After years of color damage and brittle behaviour, her hair looked and felt better and healthier. </p>

			<h2>WE’RE IN LOVE WITH THE COCO</h2>
			<p>Why does NIUCOCO work so well on damaged hair? Because its coconut content is so high and coconut is a rich, natural source for Vitamin E, and when infused in the hair products that you use, your follicles by result reap the benefits and automatically revitalize.</p>
			<p>But not just any type of coconut works, and not all coconut oils are created equally! The best quality coconut oil is <span>EXTRA VIRGIN</span>, <span>COLD PRESSED</span>,<span> UNREFINED</span>, which is what NIUCOCO uses in each and every one of its products. Its brand is so on point with clean, pure ingredients that they even scored green on ThinkDirty, which is what all organic brands strive for.</p>

				<h2>COCO FOR ALL</h2>
				<p>What’s also great about NIUCOCO is that their product line is ideal for all hair types as well, because they only have the objective of making hair healthier. They also have an amazing non-aerosol dry shampoo spray that is honestly a lifesaver! I recently went through an embarrassing slump of a week where I didn’t wash my hair as used NIUCOCO dry shampoo sneakily, and no one noticed a thing. Moreover, I felt good, and there wasn’t even any residue. Less messes, no stresses, better tresses!</p>

			<h2>What women are saying about us...</h2>

				<h3>Amber P.</h3>

				<h4>Great product!</h4>
				<p>Makes my hair super soft! I have very hard water where I live and it does a great job of counteracting it, even if I just use it 3/4 times a week. The shampoo is very liquidy and needs to be shaken because it's nature, just FYI. It also doesn't foam up as much as a 'normal' shampoo but this makes no difference in how well it works. Really enjoying it!</p>

				<h4>Never had better hair!</h4>
				<p>I've been trying different products over the past year and I am most pleased with Niucoco's products. My hair has never been softer and the scent reminds me of those beautiful surf days!</p>

				<h4>Good product but poor container quality..</h4>
				<p>The shampoo is great, the smell is good and it works great on my fuzzy hair. However, I drop it off by accident after two uses, and the lid broke into half!! Now I have to cover it with a plastic wrap... So inconvenient... Hope the container quality would improve in later products</p>
