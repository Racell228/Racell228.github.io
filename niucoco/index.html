		<h1>The Secret’s out! This Montreal Company Is Offering Free Samples to Fix Frizzy, Dry and Broken Hair</h1>
	</section>
	<section>
		<div class="container">
			<p class="hero_p">I had just about given up on restoring the quality of my hair under ever-changing weather until I discovered this one local brand that would solve all my problems: Itchy scalp, dry, brittle hair, lifelessness and frizz.</p>
			<h2>But then, I met NIUCOCO.</h2>
			<p>NIUCOCO is an organic Montreal haircare brand that uses 100% virgin coconut oil in a mighty collection of haircare products. I heard about the brand when I was looking for remedies to soothe my troublesome hair, and the fact that it’s from Montreal was automatically a plus to me. Being a Montrealer myself, I strongly believe in supporting local brands and businesses, and know that they’re probably going to end up being better for you, anyway.</p>
			<p>What also sets NIUCOCO apart from pharmacy and on-the-shelf grade haircare products is the fact that they focus on the science behind Vitamin E acting as food for your hair. I’ve switched many a shampoo in my time and I haven’t seen Vitamin E advertised ANYWHERE on haircare products, so you could imagine my surprise upon finding this out.</p>
			<p>Your hair, just like any part of your body, requires proper nourishment to keep it healthy, and Vitamin E, is exactly the ingredient that feeds it best. Why? Because just like it does for our skin, it keeps our hair looking young, and unrefined coconut oil is chockfull of it.</p>

			<h2>The Verdict</h2>
			<p>So after using NIUCOCO for a couple of weeks, I automatically started noticing a difference of attitude in my hair, and I found a new slew of products that I would soon become dependent on.</p>
			<p>This triple threat dubbed “Dynamic Hair Trio” comes in an easy 1,2,3 package deal for haircare. What does it entail?</p>
			<p>1. <b>Shampoo:</b> Shake well before using. Apply desired amount onto wet hair and massage into a lather. Rinse and repeat as needed.
			<br>2. <b>Conditioner:</b> After shampooing, apply to damp hair and work through, concentrating on the ends. Leave on for 1 to 3 minutes, then rinse.
			<br>3. <b>Renewing Hair Serum:</b> Spread a few drops in your palm, then apply to wet or dry hair. Style as usual.</p>

			<p>So you can imagine how hydrated my hair must’ve felt after a full two weeks of this routine! Don’t think I’m gross, but I wash AND condition 1-2 times a week (that’s what you’re supposed to do, I swear!) But because I swim, too, I’ll sneak in an extra conditioning session at some point during the week as well. This leaves everything feeling nice and soft, and keeps whatever chlorine that penetrated the thin layer of swim cap protecting my hair at bay.</p>
			<p>My experience with the serum was “I can’t stop running my fingers through my hair when it’s straight” amazing - because of just that. I’ve been using this serum whenever I straighten my hair, which is about 1-2 times every 1-2 weeks. The serum added a high-gloss effect that others noticed right away, and essentially started asking me what I was using on the regular, wondering what I was using for my hair that was making it look shinier than usual.</p>

			<p>I almost don’t want to say the serum is a miracle worker, but it actually is! It makes enough of a difference for me to notice a healthier sheen to my hair. It acts as a necessary addition to everyday styling, touchups and glossiness.</p>

				<h3>Amber P.</h3>
				<img src="img/stars.png">
				<h4>Great product!</h4>
				<p>Makes my hair super soft! I have very hard water where I live and it does a great job of counteracting it, even if I just use it 3/4 times a week. The shampoo is very liquidy and needs to be shaken because it's nature, just FYI. It also doesn't foam up as much as a 'normal' shampoo but this makes no difference in how well it works. Really enjoying it!</p>

			<div class="rewievs_item">
				<h3>Ricky J.</h3>
				<img src="img/stars.png">
				<h4>Never had better hair!</h4>
				<p>I've been trying different products over the past year and I am most pleased with Niucoco's products. My hair has never been softer and the scent reminds me of those beautiful surf days!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="rewievs_item">
				<h3>Hehuan M.</h3>
				<img src="img/stars.png">
				<h4>Good product but poor container quality..</h4>
				<p>The shampoo is great, the smell is good and it works great on my fuzzy hair. However, I drop it off by accident after two uses, and the lid broke into half!! Now I have to cover it with a plastic wrap... So inconvenient... Hope the container quality would improve in later products</p>

				<p>I’m curious to see what else I can try out by this amazing brand. I’m very curious about their Non-Aerosol Dry Shampoo, since using dry shampoo is actually great for maintaining the health of your hair instead of washing it all the time.</p>
				<p>I think it’s now safe to say that I am now Crazy for the Coco - or should I say I feel like a NIUPERSON?</p>
