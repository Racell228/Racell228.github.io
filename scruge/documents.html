				<p>Effective Date 08.02.2019</p>
				<p>Welcome to SCRUGE, an online loyalty program with augmented reality, where customer and retail meets.</p>
				<p>SCRUGE is owned and operated by Gigantiq Inc. (“SCRUGE,” “we,” “our” or “us”). SCRUGE respects your privacy concerns and recognizes that our users need to understand how their information may be used or shared. This “Privacy Policy” governs your use of our site <a href="https://Scruge.co">https://Scruge.co</a> and associated applications (e.g. on Apple’s iTunes or Google’s Play Store), and any other of our sites that post a copy of it (including both mobile and online versions of our site), including such interactive features, widgets, applications, content or downloads that we own and make available in connection with such site(s) (collectively, the “Service”) regardless of how you access or use them, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise.</p>
				<h3>1. What information we get and how we get it</h3>
				<p>This Privacy Policy covers our use of any information that can or could be used to identify you <b>("Personal Data")</b>. It does not cover information which cannot be used to identify you  <b>("Anonymous Data")</b></p>
				<p>We need to collect and use certain Personal Data to provide the Services to you and fulfil the promises we make to you in the Terms of Service:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						When you sign up for our Services you give us Personal Data voluntarily by providing it to us, for example when you sign up for an account. We collect and use that information in order to authenticate you when you register an account and use the Services, to make sure you are eligible and able to receive the Services, and so that you receive the correct version of the Services. That information includes the in-game username you choose to use on our Services, and internal account IDs that we assign to your account.
					</li>
					<li>You must have an account with a supported third party single sign-on service to use our Services. As such, the Personal Data we collect also depends on which third party accounts you choose to use, their privacy policy, and what your privacy settings with those services allow us to see when you use their services to access SCRUGE Services.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>If you choose to link your Google account to the Services, we will collect your Google email address and an authentication token provided by Google.</li>
						<li>If you choose to link your Facebook account to the Services, we will collect a unique user ID provided by Facebook and, if permitted by you, your Facebook registered email address.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>
						<p>
						Depending on the particular Service you sign up for, we may support other third party single sign-on services and collect additional Personal Data from them. For details please read the Game Specific Disclosures at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>
						<p>Some third-party providers may notify you that they make additional information, such as your public profile, available to us when you use their single sign-on services. We do not collect that information from them.</p>	
					</li>
					<li>We collect and use your device location information as you use our Services (and, if you elect to turn on background location tracking for our Services, while you are not directly interacting with the Services), including how you move around and events that occur during gameplay. Our Services include location based games whose core feature is to provide a gameplay experience tied to your real world location, so we need to know where you are to operate these games for you, and to plan the location of in-game resources. We identify your location using a variety of technologies, including GPS, the WiFi points you are accessing the Service through and mobile/cell tower triangulation.</li>
					<li>
						We also collect and use your in-game actions and achievements, as well as certain information about your mobile device (including device identifiers, device OS, model, configuration, settings and information about third party applications or software installed on your device), to operate the Services for you and to ensure that we provide a fair gaming experience to all players in accordance with our Terms of Service (which includes anti-fraud and anti-cheating measures against behaviors prohibited under our Terms of Service).
					</li>
					<li>We further use the information above in order to provide technical and customer support to you.</li>
					<li><p>You also give us Personal Data when you make a purchase through us, subscribe to our publications, register for a live event, enter a competition, promotion,  or survey or communicate with us. Depending on which of these Services you use, that may include your name, mailing address, phone number, country of residency, date of birth (as needed to verify eligibility), and email address. We use that information to fulfil those Services to you and to provide related customer support to you.</p>
						<p>
							In addition, we have and rely on a legitimate interest in using your Personal Data as follows:		
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Using your IP address, browser type, operating system, the web page you were visiting before accessing our Services, the pages of our Services which you browsed or the features you used, and the time spent on those pages or features, the links on our Services that you click on, device identifiers, as well as actions you take during gameplay, your in-game user settings and preferences and your in-app purchases to understand who is using our Services and how.
					</li>
					<li>Using your contact information, namely your email address in order to communicate with you to provide technical and customer support.</li>
					<li>Using your internal account ID in order to attribute to your account any user content (such as local points of interest) that you elect to submit to SCRUGE through the Services.</li>
					<li>Using your email address and device information in order to share updates and news about the Services with you either within the games or by email. You can unsubscribe from these at any time in your device settings.</li>
					<li>To provide social features within our games so you can interact and play with other players, including storing your communications with those players, find your friends and be found by them, and share your gameplay experience and achievements with your friends.</li>
					<li>To offer new or additional features for our Services.</li>
					<li>To carry out anti-fraud and anti-cheating measures and to ensure that you and other users are complying with our Terms of Service.</li>
					<li>To make legal or regulatory disclosures.</li>
					<li>Send you marketing materials by email or via in-app notifications. You can unsubscribe from these at any time in your device settings or in-app settings.</li>
					<li><p>We also rely on your consent where we use cookies or similar technologies. Please see our Cookie Policy - https^ for more information about how we use them. Insofar as cookies collect Personal Data, we will process it only based on your explicit consent, in anonymized form, or under a pseudonym.</p>
						<p>
							While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings, SCRUGE currently does not respond to a "Do Not Track" signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application due to the lack of industry standard on how to interpret that signal.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
					<h3>2. How we use this information.</h3>
					<p>Where is it stored (disklozer, storage time) and how information is moved</p>
					<p>SCRUGE operates its Services across the globe. Your Personal Data will very likely be transferred and stored in a country outside of your home country, including in the USA, for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. The data protection laws in these countries may not be the same as in your home country.</p>
					<p>If we transfer your Personal Data from the EEA to other countries, including the USA, we ensure that a similar degree of protection is provided to your Personal Data as within the EEA by ensuring that at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The country that your Personal Data is transferred to is a country that the European Commission has deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data as the EEA.</li>
						<li>We use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give Personal Data the same protection as it has in Europe when we engage with service providers.</li>
						<li>Where we engage with service providers in the USA, they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield, which requires them to provide the same protection of your Personal Data as it has in the EEA.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>3. How we keep your Personal Data safe</h3>
					<p>We have appropriate security measures in place to prevent your Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, improperly altered or disclosed. We also limit access to your Personal Data to employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your Personal Data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
				<h3>4. How long we will keep your Personal Data</h3>
					<p>We keep your Personal Data for as long as we need to provide the Services to you and fulfil the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carry out services on our behalf.</p>
					<p> When we no longer need to use your Personal Data and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we will either remove it from our systems or anonymize it so that it can no longer be associated with you.</p>
				<h3>5. Disclosure of your information</h3>
					<p>We disclose the information we collect, in the following ways:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Affiliates and Subsidiaries.</b> Amongst our affiliated and subsidiary companies in furtherance of the purposes set out in this Policy; their use of your information is subject to this Privacy Policy.</li>
					<li><b>Business Partners and Third Parties.</b> We may share your information with business partners who jointly sponsor events with us, from time to time; where required by applicable law, we will obtain your prior consent. You may at any time withdraw your consent or tell us to stop sharing your personal information (as defined under applicable law) with business partners and third parties by following the opt-out process described in the “Your Choices” section below. If you use the Services through a third-party platform that manages its own fleet of Bird vehicles, we will also share your information with the platform operator to assist in operating the Services.</li>
					<li><b>Third-Party Service Providers.</b> We use a variety of third party service providers that perform functions on our behalf, such as hosting, billing and payment processing, push notifications, storage, bandwidth, content management tools, analytics, customer service, fraud protection, etc.</li>
					<li><b>General Business Operations.</b> Where necessary to the administration of our general business, accounting, record keeping and legal functions, to our tax advisors, legal counsel and other professional services entities or agents.</li>
					<li><b>Legal Compliance and Protection of Rights.</b> We may also use or disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or the Services; (b) establish, protect and defend our rights or property, the Services or our users, including to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use and other agreements or policies, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved; and (c) act under emergency circumstances to protect the personal safety of us, our affiliates, agents, or users of the Services or the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.</li>

Any information that you submit through such features is not confidential and may be accessed by others. For example, if you submit a product review on one of our Sites, we may display your review (along with the name provided, if any) on third-party websites. Moreover, if you provide a comment on our blog, other blog readers will be able to review your comments, and if you interact with us on our social media pages, your comments will be publicly available. So, please take care when using these features. If you’d like to request removal of information that we have posted about you, please contact us via email.</li>
					<li><b>Aggregate / Anonymous Information.</b> We may share aggregate / anonymous information about use of the Services with third parties for research, marketing, analytics and other purposes, provided such information does not identify a particular individual, such as by publishing a report on usage trends. The sharing of such data is unrestricted.</li>
					<li><b>Business Transfers.</b> As we continue to develop our business, we may seek to buy, merge, or partner with other companies. In such transactions, (including in contemplation of such transactions) user information may be among the transferred assets. If a portion or all of our assets are sold or transferred to a third party, customer information would likely be one of the transferred business assets. If such transfer is subject to additional mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, we will comply with such restrictions.</li>
