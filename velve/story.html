				<div class="story_ethos_content">
					<p>Like most women, I wear many hats—daughter, sister, wife, mother, friend, tech executive, world traveler, philanthropist, mentor, visionary, and entrepreneur. But before I stepped into many of these roles, I was a young woman struggling with problematic skin. For over a decade, I battled acne, acne scars, melasma, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. If you’ve ever faced skin issues, you know how they can quietly erode your confidence, making you feel like a stranger in your own skin.</p>
					<p>For me, it wasn’t just about acne; it was about how it made me feel. I became consumed by it, hiding behind layers of makeup and letting my skin dictate how I lived. I even planned to edit the “getting ready” footage out of my future wedding video, long before I was even dating anyone. That’s how deeply self-conscious I felt.</p>
					<p>The solution seemed simple: clear skin. Yet, it felt frustratingly out of reach. I tried everything, but nothing worked. That’s when I stopped searching for quick fixes and started looking for a true solution.</p>
					<p>I found my answer in the beauty secrets of my ancestors—ancient African botanicals revered for their ability to heal, nourish, and transform. That discovery changed everything.</p>
					<p>Velvé was born from this journey—for every ambitious, unstoppable woman who refuses to let anything, not even her skin, hold her back. I created Velvé for my younger self, for every woman who’s ever felt held back by skin struggles, and for you.</p>
					<p>With Velvé, my mission is to empower you to reclaim your time, confidence, and power. Because life is too short to hide behind insecurities or makeup. You deserve to show up, unapologetically, with nothing to hide and everything to conquer.</p>
					<p>For the beautifully unstoppable,<br>
					Cynthia<br>
					Founder, Velvé</p>
