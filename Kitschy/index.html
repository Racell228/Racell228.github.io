					<h2>founder</h2>
					<p>tracy is a digital media strategist with extensive experience in e-commerce and subscription-based products in the beauty and cosmetics world. Her career in online marketing began in affiliate marketing where she learnt the importance of data and how important it is to understand numbers to save money and maximize results. Her instinct to discover and strategize marketing breakthroughs and trends has led her to co-found Media Burn, a performance-based agency specializing in eCommerce and influencer match-ups where she served as a Chief-Operating Officer.</p>
					<p>Her passion to create was not satisfied fully, so she decided to launch Kitschy where she can oversee the creative direction of brands she loves and continue to do what she’s good at doing, marketing! Today, she’s living the life she exactly wants between Los Angeles and Montreal, and manages her dream team with a strong ethos for women seizing professional opportunities with gusto, and hopefully empowering them to turn their dreams into reality through the power of manifestation and a ton of hard work! </p>
